# Day 10 - Multi-Step Portfolio Form 🧾

This is Day 10 of my 30-Day React Relearning Journey. Today’s project is a **multi-step form** — a crucial feature in many modern applications.

I built a 3-step "Portfolio Application" form that includes:

- Step navigation (Profile → Experience → Review)
- Input validation using `react-hook-form`
- Dark mode support with persistent localStorage
- Clean and readable form UI in both light and dark modes
- Modular, reusable components
- Glassmorphism + animated design using Tailwind CSS
- Data persistence using localStorage
